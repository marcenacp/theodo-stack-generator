## Getting started

Useful commands:

* `yarn` to install dependencies

* `yarn start` to start a local dev-server

* `yarn build` to build a minified version of the code, for production use!

* `yarn test` to launch tests

* `yarn lint:fix` to automatically fix linting errors

* `yarn test:coverage` to generate the coverage

* `yarn generate` to generate a new component or a new page, don't waste your time!

* `yarn nsp` to spot security breaches in your application

* `yarn analyze` to analyze the production bundle size
